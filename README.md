Hello

 - I am not a developer or programmer
 - I am just a guy who wanted Counter-Strike 2 running via CrossOver to be detected by Discord Rich Presence



 - My name is Irakli and I wanted to share what I made





 - This app is called CrossStrike

You can install it either by downloading the ZIP file and unzipping it
 - or by downloading the source code and checking it yourself

This app is not notarized by Apple
because I currently do not have the budget
to afford the 99$ Apple Developer Program





 - This app runs in the background

The app watches for Discord and cs2.exe
When both are detected
it activates Discord Rich Presence using the correct App ID

 - You can enable "Launch at Login" from the menu bar
 - It counts time from when you start playing
 - and automatically stops when you quit CS2



The app requires

 - Full Disk Access
 - Accessibility permission

If you install the app from the ZIP file
go to System Settings > Security
scroll down
and click "Open Anyway"

The app is simple
it uses about 30 MB of RAM
and it has been stable as far as I have tested

No data is collected
Everything runs locally on your machine
